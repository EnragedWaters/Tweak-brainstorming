IDEAS for Tweaks

//ALREADY STARTED//
PLAYER ARENA - more matches per day
HOUSE SERVANTS - more of them
QUEST BOARD HIGHLIGHTING - quest descriptions turn into green color if you have item already
//===============//

//IDEAS//

TREASURE MAPS - tweak it for an "easy mode" since default is kinda vague as hell with snow areas
FIXING BUFF SPELL DESCRIPTIONS - they don't account for spell power
^FIXING BUFF DESCRIPTIONS - text is short-handed and cut-off. How annoying.
